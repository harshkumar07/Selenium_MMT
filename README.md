Project Name: MakeMyTrip Automation using Selenium WebDriver

Description:
This project is a demonstration of automating the booking functionality on the MakeMyTrip railways website using Selenium WebDriver in Java. The automation script interacts with various elements on the website, such as input fields, dropdowns, and buttons, to simulate the user's actions and perform the booking process. It validates the page title, enters the source and destination cities, selects the desired options from the suggestion list, clicks on the search button, and performs additional steps as specified. Screenshots and logs of the automation steps can also be saved for reference. This project serves as a reference and starting point for automating similar functionalities on other websites using Selenium WebDriver.

Technologies used:

Java
Selenium WebDriver
ChromeDriver
TestNG (optional, for test framework)
Features:

Navigates to the MakeMyTrip railways website and validates the landing page.
Enters the source and destination cities for train booking.
Selects the desired cities from the suggestion list.
Clicks on the search button to initiate the search process.
Includes delay for synchronization between steps.
Can be extended and customized for additional functionality and test scenarios.
This project can be helpful for developers and automation testers who want to learn and practice web automation using Selenium WebDriver with Java. It provides a foundation for automating similar booking functionalities and can be enhanced based on specific project requirements.

Feel free to modify and enhance the project according to your needs, and contribute to the open-source community on GitHub.
